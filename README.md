# INTRODUCTION
------------

Our university project "3Dsections" is a C++ project based on well-known graphic libraries like "wxWidgets Library"
which provide display animation on a computer screen. By "animation" we mean a section of a three-dimensional solid 
framework which is moving at a constant speed through a plane. That solid framework is determined by lines formed at
the intersection - points of the walls forming the solid.


# BASIC FUNCTION
--------------

The project provide following basic facilities:
	1) Read the data of 3D solid from a text file and display on the screen.
	2) Set the framework speed by user along X, Y or Z axis.
