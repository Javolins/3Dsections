# INTRODUCTION
--------------

Our university project "3Dsections" is a C++ project based on well-known graphic libraries like "wxWidgets Library"
which provide display animation on a computer screen. By "animation" we mean a section of a three-dimensional solid 
framework which is moving at a constant speed through a plane. That solid framework is determined by lines formed at
the intersection - points of the walls forming the solid.


## BASIC FUNCTION
The project provide following basic facilities: 
* Read the data of 3D solid from a text file and display on the screen.
* Set the framework speed by user along X, Y or Z axis. 
* Smooth display moving 3D animation.
	


## EXTENDED FUNCTION
The project provide following extended facilities:
* Selecting extended plane option (for example: plane normal vector)
* Drawing various solid, placed one inside other respectively, which are indicated by different colors.
* Possibility of saving the sequence of animation frames to graphic files in BMP format
